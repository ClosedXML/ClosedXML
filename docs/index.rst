ClosedXML
*********

ClosedXML is a .NET library for reading, manipulating and writing Excel 2007+ (.xlsx, .xlsm) files. It aims to provide an intuitive and
user-friendly interface to dealing with the underlying OpenXML API.

Install the library through .NET CLI

.. code-block:: batch

   C:\source> dotnet add package ClosedXML

ClosedXML allows you to create Excel files without the Excel application. The typical example is creating Excel reports on a web server.

.. code-block:: csharp

   using var workbook = new XLWorkbook();
   var worksheet = workbook.AddWorksheet("Sample Sheet");
   worksheet.Cell("A1").Value = "Hello World!";
   worksheet.Cell("A2").FormulaA1 = "MID(A1, 7, 5)";
   workbook.SaveAs("HelloWorld.xlsx");
