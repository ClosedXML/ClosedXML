{
    // Where possible, post full code to reproduce your issue that adheres to:
    // - Fully runnable. I should be able to copy and paste this code into a 
    //   console application and run it without having to edit it much.
    // - Declare all your variables (this follows from the previous point)
    // - The code should be a minimal code sample to illustrate issue. The code 
    //   samples on the wiki are good examples of the terseness that I want. Don't
    //   post your full application.
