## Reproducibility
**This is an important section. Read it carefully. Failure to do so will cause a 'RTFM' comment.**

Without a code sample, it is unlikely that your issue will get attention. Don't be lazy. Do the effort and assist the developers to reproduce your problem. Code samples should be [minimal complete and verifiable](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). Sample spreadsheets should be attached whenever applicable. Remove sensitive information.

**Code to reproduce problem:**
```c#
public void Main()
{
    // Code standards:
    // - Fully runnable. I should be able to copy and paste this code into a 
    //   console application and run it without having to edit it much.
    // - Declare all your variables (this follows from the previous point)
    // - The code should be a minimal code sample to illustrate issue. The code 
    //   samples on the wiki are good examples of the terseness that I want. Don't
    //   post your full application.
}
```
- [ ] I attached a sample spreadsheet.  (You can drag files on to this issue)
