ClosedXML is a .NET library for reading, manipulating and writing Excel 2007+ (.xlsx, .xlsm) files. It aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to dealing with the underlying [OpenXML](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) API.

For more information see [the documentation](https://closedxml.readthedocs.io/) or [the wiki](https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki).

### Release notes & migration guide

The public API is still not stable and it is a very good idea to **read release notes** and **migration guide** before each update.
* [Release notes for 0.100](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML/releases/tag/0.100.0)
* [Migration guide for 0.100](https://closedxml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrations/migrate-to-0.100.html)
* [Release notes for 0.97](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML/releases/tag/0.97.0)

### Performance

Performance matters mostly for large files. For small files, few ms here or there doesn't matter. The presented data are from generally develop branch (currently [0.103-beta](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML/commit/5f7c0d9461352a6a468e5299bfef6eaf82bf37da)).

### Frequent answers
- If you get an exception `Unable to find font font name or fallback font fallback font name. Install missing fonts or specify a different fallback font through ‚ÄòLoadOptions.DefaultGraphicEngine = new DefaultGraphicEngine(‚ÄúFallback font name‚Äù)‚Äô`, see help page about [missing fonts](https://closedxml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips/missing-font.html).
- ClosedXML is not thread-safe. There is no guarantee that [parallel operations](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML/issues/1662) will work. The underlying OpenXML library is also not thread-safe.
- If you get an exception `The type initializer for 'Gdip' threw an exception.` on Linux, you have to upgrade to 0.97+.

### Install ClosedXML via NuGet

If you want to include ClosedXML in your project, you can [install it directly from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ClosedXML)

To install ClosedXML, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

```
PM> Install-Package ClosedXML
```

### What can you do with this?

ClosedXML allows you to create Excel files without the Excel application. The typical example is creating Excel reports on a web server.

**Example:**
```c#
using (var workbook = new XLWorkbook())
{
    var worksheet = workbook.Worksheets.Add("Sample Sheet");
    worksheet.Cell("A1").Value = "Hello World!";
    worksheet.Cell("A2").FormulaA1 = "=MID(A1, 7, 5)";
    workbook.SaveAs("HelloWorld.xlsx");
}
```

## Developer guidelines
The [OpenXML specification](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/) is a large and complicated beast. In order for ClosedXML, the wrapper around OpenXML, to support all the features, we rely on community contributions. Before opening an issue to request a new feature, we'd like to urge you to try to implement it yourself and log a pull request.

Please read the [full developer guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
