ClosedXML is a .NET library for reading, manipulating and writing Excel 2007+ (.xlsx, .xlsm) files. It aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to dealing with the underlying [OpenXML](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) API.

[For more information see the wiki](https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki)

### Install ClosedXML via NuGet

If you want to include ClosedXML in your project, you can [install it directly from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ClosedXML)

To install ClosedXML, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

```
PM> Install-Package ClosedXML
```

### What can you do with this?

ClosedXML allows you to create Excel files without the Excel application. The typical example is creating Excel reports on a web server.

**Example:**
```c#
using (var workbook = new XLWorkbook())
{
    var worksheet = workbook.Worksheets.Add("Sample Sheet");
    worksheet.Cell("A1").Value = "Hello World!";
    worksheet.Cell("A2").FormulaA1 = "=MID(A1, 7, 5)";
    workbook.SaveAs("HelloWorld.xlsx");
}
```

## Developer guidelines
_Full guidelines to follow later_
* Please submit pull requests that are based on the `develop` branch.
* Where possible, pull requests should include unit tests that cover as many uses cases as possible. This is especially relevant when implementing Excel functions.
* Install [NUnit 3.0 Test Adapter](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Installation) if you want to run the test suite in Visual Studio.
* We use 4 spaces for code indentation. This is the default in Visual Studio. Don't leave any trailing white space at the end of lines or files. To make this easier, ClosedXML has an [editorconfig](http://www.editorconfig.org) configuration file. It is recommended you install editorconfig from the Visual Studio Extension Manager.
