ClosedXML is a .NET library for reading, manipulating and writing Excel 2007+ (.xlsx, .xlsm) files. It aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to dealing with the underlying [OpenXML](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) API.

[For more information see the wiki](https://github.com/closedxml/closedxml/wiki)

### Install ClosedXML via NuGet

If you want to include ClosedXML in your project, you can [install it directly from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ClosedXML)

To install ClosedXML, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

```
PM> Install-Package ClosedXML
```

### What can you do with this?

ClosedXML allows you to create Excel files without the Excel application. The typical example is creating Excel reports on a web server.

**Example:**
```c#
using (var workbook = new XLWorkbook())
{
    var worksheet = workbook.Worksheets.Add("Sample Sheet");
    worksheet.Cell("A1").Value = "Hello World!";
    worksheet.Cell("A2").FormulaA1 = "=MID(A1, 7, 5)";
    workbook.SaveAs("HelloWorld.xlsx");
}
```

## Developer guidelines
The [OpenXML specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm) is a large and complicated beast. In order for ClosedXML, the wrapper around OpenXML, to support all the features, we rely on community contributions. Before opening an issue to request a new feature, we'd like to urge you to try to implement it yourself and log a pull request.

Please read the [full developer guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
